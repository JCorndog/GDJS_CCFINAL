            Among demographic factors that affect engagement, Age is high on the list.
            As shown in the graph below, engagement is highest in customers in the age
            range 45-54.

            A factor that doesn't significantly impact engagement is the presence of children. 
            While "Households with no children" is the largest engagement demographic, the three
            demographics which make up the "Has Children" almost, collectively, equal the engagement
            of those with no children. This is shown in the below graph.
